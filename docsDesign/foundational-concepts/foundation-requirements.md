# Foundation Requirements for OTP Supervisor Educational Tool

## Overview

This document identifies the essential Elixir/OTP concepts required to build a comprehensive supervisor educational tool. These concepts form the knowledge foundation that both developers and users of the tool need to understand.

## Core Foundational Concepts

### 1. Process Fundamentals (Critical)
**Why Essential:** Processes are the atomic unit of concurrency in Elixir. Without understanding processes, supervisors have no meaning.

**Required Knowledge:**
- Process creation (`spawn`, `spawn_link`)
- Process identification (PIDs)
- Process lifecycle and states
- Process isolation benefits
- Process naming and registration

**Tool Integration:**
- Visual representation of process states
- Interactive process creation/destruction
- PID tracking and display

### 2. Message Passing (Critical)
**Why Essential:** All OTP behaviors communicate via messages. Understanding message passing is crucial for debugging supervision issues.

**Required Knowledge:**
- `send/2` and `receive` blocks
- Mailbox concept
- Message ordering guarantees
- Selective receive patterns

**Tool Integration:**
- Message queue visualization
- Interactive message sending
- Mailbox inspection features

### 3. Links and Monitors (Critical)
**Why Essential:** Supervisors work through process linking. This is the mechanism that enables automatic restarts.

**Required Knowledge:**
- Bidirectional links vs unidirectional monitors
- EXIT signal propagation
- Trapping exits
- Link/monitor use cases

**Tool Integration:**
- Visual link/monitor relationships
- Interactive link creation/breaking
- EXIT signal visualization

### 4. GenServer Pattern (Critical)
**Why Essential:** Most supervised processes are GenServers. Users need to understand this abstraction.

**Required Knowledge:**
- Client-server architecture
- Synchronous vs asynchronous calls
- State management
- Lifecycle callbacks

**Tool Integration:**
- GenServer state inspection
- Call/cast interaction demos
- Timeout scenarios

### 5. Supervisor Behavior (Critical)
**Why Essential:** This is the core focus of the educational tool.

**Required Knowledge:**
- Supervision strategies (one_for_one, all_for_one, rest_for_one)
- Child specifications
- Restart options (permanent, temporary, transient)
- Supervision tree hierarchies

**Tool Integration:**
- Strategy visualization and switching
- Interactive child management
- Restart behavior demonstrations

## Secondary Foundational Concepts

### 6. Application Structure (Important)
**Why Essential:** Supervisors exist within applications. Understanding application structure helps with real-world usage.

**Required Knowledge:**
- Application behavior
- Application supervision tree
- Start/stop callbacks
- Configuration

**Tool Integration:**
- Application tree visualization
- Configuration examples

### 7. Dynamic Supervisors (Important)
**Why Essential:** Many real-world systems need runtime child creation.

**Required Knowledge:**
- DynamicSupervisor vs Supervisor
- Runtime child addition/removal
- Use cases and patterns

**Tool Integration:**
- Dynamic child creation UI
- Resource pool examples

### 8. Agent Behavior (Useful)
**Why Essential:** Simpler than GenServer, good for teaching state management.

**Required Knowledge:**
- Agent vs GenServer
- Simple state operations
- When to use Agents

**Tool Integration:**
- Agent examples in sandbox
- State manipulation demos

## Anti-Patterns to Address

### Process Misuse
- Using processes for code organization
- Creating unsupervised processes
- Sending unnecessary data between processes

### Supervision Mistakes
- Wrong strategy selection
- Improper restart configurations
- Missing error handling

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1 Prerequisites (Current)
1. Basic process operations
2. Simple GenServers
3. Basic supervisor with one_for_one
4. Process inspection

### Phase 2 Prerequisites
1. All supervision strategies
2. Dynamic supervisors
3. Process linking demonstrations
4. Message passing visualization

### Phase 3 Prerequisites
1. Complex supervision trees
2. Application structure
3. Error propagation patterns
4. Performance considerations

## Learning Path Recommendations

### Beginner Path
1. Processes → Message Passing → GenServer → Basic Supervisor
2. Focus on visual understanding
3. Simple sandbox examples

### Intermediate Path
1. Links/Monitors → Supervision Strategies → Dynamic Supervisors
2. Error handling scenarios
3. Real-world patterns

### Advanced Path
1. Complex hierarchies → Performance → Production patterns
2. Anti-pattern recognition
3. Architecture design

## Next Steps

1. Implement missing Phase 1 components (Prompts 2-10)
2. Create interactive tutorials for each concept
3. Build visualization components for process relationships
4. Develop sandbox scenarios demonstrating each concept
5. Create assessment exercises for concept mastery
