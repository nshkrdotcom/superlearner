# Enhanced Phase 1: Building a Professional OTP Control Platform

## Revised Vision for Phase 1

Phase 1 is no longer just "basic supervisor control" - it's laying the foundation for a **professional-grade OTP introspection and control platform**. Every API we build should be production-ready and useful for real-world debugging and system analysis.

## Enhanced Core Control Module

### Original Phase 1 Scope (Your Plan)
```elixir
# Basic supervisor operations
list_supervisors/0
get_supervision_tree/1
kill_process/1
get_process_info/1
```

### Enhanced Phase 1 Scope (Professional Tool)
```elixir
defmodule OTPSupervisor.Core.Control do
  @moduledoc """
  Comprehensive OTP control and introspection API.
  This is a production-ready tool for system analysis and debugging.
  """

    # Find all processes running specific module code
  end

    # Include non-supervised processes with warnings
  end

  # === Deep Process Introspection ===

    # Selective field retrieval for performance
    # fields: [:memory, :messages, :links, :dictionary, :current_function, etc.]
  end

    # If tracing enabled, return historical data
    # Includes: past states, messages, function calls
  end

  def build_relationship_graph do
    # Complete graph of all process relationships

  end

  # === Process Manipulation ===
  def send_message(pid, message, opts \\ []) do
    # Options: timeout, trace, record
    # Can record for replay later
  end

    # Pause process execution (using :erlang.suspend_process)
  end

  def resume_process(pid) do
    # Resume suspended process
  end

  def inject_debug_code(pid, code) do
    # Hot code injection for debugging
    # Example: Add logging to a running GenServer
  end

  # === Supervisor Operations (Enhanced) ===
  def get_supervisor_analytics(supervisor) do
    # Returns:
    # - Restart frequency over time
    # - Most crashed children
    # - Average uptime per child
    # - Resource usage trends
  end

  def simulate_failure(supervisor, child_id, reason) do
    # Controlled failure injection
    # Records metrics before/after
  end

  def change_supervision_strategy(supervisor, new_strategy) do
    # Runtime strategy modification
    # With safety checks and rollback
  end

  def pause_supervision(supervisor) do
    # Temporarily prevent restarts
    # Useful during maintenance
  end

  # === System Analysis ===
  def analyze_system_health do
    %{
      process_count: count,
      supervised_percentage: percentage,
      orphan_processes: orphans,
      high_memory_processes: memory_hogs,

    # Find processes with growing message queues
    # Identify synchronous call chains
  end

  def generate_system_report do
    # Comprehensive system analysis

  end

  # === Performance Profiling ===
  def profile_process(pid, duration_ms) do
    # Real-time performance profiling
    # CPU, memory, message processing rates
  end

  def benchmark_supervision_tree(supervisor) do
    # Measure restart times, resource usage
  end

  # === Message Flow Analysis ===
  def trace_message_flow(initial_message) do
    # Follow a message through the system
    # Visualize the path it takes
  end

  def analyze_message_patterns do
    # Identify common message patterns
    # Detect unusual activity

end
```

## Enhanced Sandbox Workers

Instead of just Counter and Printer, create workers that demonstrate real patterns:

### 1. StatefulWorker (Enhanced Counter)
```elixir
defmodule OTPSupervisor.Sandbox.Workers.StatefulWorker do
  use GenServer

  # Features:
  # - State history tracking
  # - Rollback capability  
  # - State snapshots
  # - Persistence simulation
  # - Memory growth patterns
  # - Selective crash modes
end
```

### 2. ResourceWorker (Connection Pool Simulator)
```elixir
defmodule OTPSupervisor.Sandbox.Workers.ResourceWorker do
  use GenServer
  
  # Features:
  # - Limited resource management
  # - Checkout/checkin pattern
  # - Timeout handling
  # - Resource leak simulation
  # - Backpressure demonstration
end
```

### 3. EventWorker (Message Hub)
```elixir
defmodule OTPSupervisor.Sandbox.Workers.EventWorker do
  use GenServer
  
  # Features:
  # - Pub/sub patterns
  # - Message routing
  # - Queue overflow handling
  # - Priority messages
  # - Dead letter queues
end
```

### 4. CascadeWorker (Failure Chain Demo)
```elixir
defmodule OTPSupervisor.Sandbox.Workers.CascadeWorker do
  use GenServer
  
  # Features:
  # - Depends on other workers
  # - Demonstrates failure propagation
  # - Circuit breaker pattern
  # - Recovery strategies
end
```
