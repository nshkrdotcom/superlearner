# PROMPT 01: Educational Framework Foundation Implementation

## Context and Overview

You are implementing the Educational Framework Foundation for an advanced OTP Supervisor platform. This is the first phase of building a comprehensive educational system that transforms the existing OTP sandbox into an interactive learning platform.

### Current System Status

The platform currently has:
- ✅ **Core Process Control** (`lib/otp_supervisor/core/control.ex`) - Complete supervisor and process management
- ✅ **Sandbox Management** (`lib/otp_supervisor/core/sandbox_manager.ex`) - Isolated sandbox creation and management  
- ✅ **Analytics Server** (`lib/otp_supervisor/core/analytics_server.ex`) - Supervisor restart tracking and analytics
- ✅ **Message Tracing** (`lib/otp_supervisor/core/message_tracer.ex`) - Process message flow analysis
- ✅ **REST API** - Complete API controllers for processes, supervisors, and system
- ✅ **LiveView Interfaces** - Real-time web interfaces

### What's Missing (Your Task)

The educational framework components are not implemented. You need to build the foundation that will enable:
- Interactive tutorials with live code execution
- Hands-on exercises with automated feedback
- Student progress tracking and analytics
- Adaptive learning based on performance
- Pattern recognition for code quality assessment

```

## Integration Requirements

### 1. Sandbox Integration

Your educational modules MUST integrate with the existing sandbox system:

```elixir
# Example integration pattern:
def create_tutorial_sandbox(tutorial_id, student_id) do
  sandbox_id = "tutorial_#{tutorial_id}_#{student_id}_#{System.unique_integer([:positive])}"
  
  case OTPSupervisor.Core.SandboxManager.create_sandbox(sandbox_id, %{
    type: :tutorial,
    tutorial_id: tutorial_id,
    student_id: student_id,
    restricted: true,
    timeout: 300_000  # 5 minutes
  }) do
    {:ok, sandbox_info} -> {:ok, sandbox_info}
    {:error, reason} -> {:error, reason}
  end
end
```

### 2. Analytics Integration

Integrate with the existing analytics server:

```elixir
# Track educational events
def track_educational_event(student_id, event_type, event_data) do
  OTPSupervisor.Core.AnalyticsServer.track_event(student_id, %{
    type: :educational_event,
    event_type: event_type,
    data: event_data,
    timestamp: System.system_time(:millisecond)
  })
end
```

### 3. REST API Integration

Create API endpoints in `lib/otp_supervisor_web/controllers/api/v1/education_controller.ex`:

```elixir
defmodule OtpSupervisorWeb.Api.V1.EducationController do
  use OtpSupervisorWeb, :controller
  
  alias OTPSupervisor.Education.Framework
  
  # Must implement these endpoints:
  # GET /api/v1/education/tutorials
  # POST /api/v1/education/tutorials/:id/start
  # GET /api/v1/education/exercises
  # POST /api/v1/education/exercises/:id/submit
  # GET /api/v1/education/progress/:student_id
end
```

## Data Structures

### Tutorial Structure

```elixir
