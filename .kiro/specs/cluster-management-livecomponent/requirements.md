# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create a fifth LiveComponent for the Phoenix OTP Supervisor platform, specifically focused on comprehensive cluster management and monitoring. The component will leverage the sophisticated Arsenal metaprogramming framework and its four existing distributed operations (ClusterTopology, ProcessList, NodeInfo, ClusterHealth) to provide real-time cluster visualization, interactive node management, and advanced distributed system debugging capabilities. It will integrate seamlessly with the existing ToolManager, ClusterStateManager, and SingleNodeSimulator to support both real multi-node clusters and simulated distributed environments.
