# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a cluster visualization page that displays all nodes, supervision trees, and processes in an interactive visual layout. The visualization provides a real-time view of the entire cluster topology with hierarchical supervision tree representation, enabling developers to understand cluster structure at a glance. This is the simplest possible implementation focused on core visualization functionality, with the capability to expand to advanced features like filtering and detailed metrics later.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer monitoring an Elixir cluster, I want to see a visual representation of all nodes and their supervision trees, so that I can quickly understand the cluster topology and identify the hierarchical structure of supervisors and processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I navigate to the cluster visualization page THEN the system SHALL display all visible cluster nodes horizontally across the screen
2. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL show each node's supervision tree growing vertically downward from the node
3. WHEN displaying supervision trees THEN the system SHALL use different visual indicators for supervisors vs workers
4. WHEN a process is alive THEN the system SHALL display it with a green status indicator
5. WHEN a process is dead THEN the system SHALL display it with a red status indicator

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer debugging cluster issues, I want to interact with the visualization elements, so that I can get detailed information about specific supervisors and processes without leaving the visualization view.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I hover over a node, supervisor, or process THEN the system SHALL display a tooltip with basic information (name, PID, type, status)
2. WHEN I click on a node, supervisor, or process THEN the system SHALL show detailed information in a side panel
3. WHEN viewing detailed information THEN the system SHALL include memory usage, message queue length, and other relevant metrics if available
4. WHEN I click outside the details panel THEN the system SHALL hide the panel

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer working with dynamic clusters, I want the visualization to update automatically, so that I can see topology changes in real-time without manual refresh.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cluster topology changes THEN the system SHALL automatically update the visualization within 5 seconds
2. WHEN new nodes join the cluster THEN the system SHALL add them to the visualization
3. WHEN nodes leave the cluster THEN the system SHALL remove them from the visualization
4. WHEN processes start or stop THEN the system SHALL update their status indicators
5. WHEN auto-refresh is disabled THEN the system SHALL provide a manual refresh button

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer using the visualization on different screen sizes, I want to navigate and zoom the visualization, so that I can view large cluster topologies effectively regardless of my display constraints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the cluster topology is larger than the viewport THEN the system SHALL provide zoom and pan capabilities
2. WHEN I use mouse wheel or pinch gestures THEN the system SHALL zoom in/out smoothly
3. WHEN I drag on the visualization THEN the system SHALL pan the view
4. WHEN zooming or panning THEN the system SHALL maintain visual clarity and readability
5. WHEN I zoom out significantly THEN the system SHALL maintain essential visual information

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer integrating this feature into the existing OTP Supervisor application, I want the visualization to follow the established UI patterns, so that it feels consistent with the rest of the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the cluster visualization THEN the system SHALL use the existing terminal-style UI theme with green text on dark background
2. WHEN displaying the page THEN the system SHALL include the standard TerminalStatusBar component
3. WHEN showing controls THEN the system SHALL use the existing form styling patterns
4. WHEN displaying loading states THEN the system SHALL use the existing loading animation patterns
5. WHEN handling errors THEN the system SHALL display them using the existing error display patterns
