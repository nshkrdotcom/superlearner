# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature creates a dedicated `/cluster-processes` page for comprehensive process distribution analysis across BEAM clusters. The page will provide real-time visibility into all processes running across cluster nodes with smart filtering, search capabilities, and detailed process information. It leverages the existing Arsenal ProcessList operation and ClusterStateManager for real-time updates.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Process Distribution Visualization

**User Story:** As a distributed systems developer, I want to see all processes across my cluster organized by node, so that I can understand process distribution and identify bottlenecks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL execute Arsenal ProcessList operation with include_details=true
2. WHEN processes are displayed THEN the system SHALL group processes by node in expandable sections
3. WHEN processes are displayed THEN the system SHALL show process count per node in section headers
4. WHEN a node section is expanded THEN the system SHALL display processes with PID, registered name, initial call, memory usage, and message queue length
5. WHEN nodes have no processes THEN the system SHALL show "No processes" message
6. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL show total process count across all nodes

### Requirement 2: Smart Filtering and Search

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to filter and search processes efficiently, so that I can quickly find specific processes or process types across the cluster.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing processes THEN the system SHALL provide filter controls for process type (supervisor, gen_server, gen_event, task, process)
2. WHEN viewing processes THEN the system SHALL provide filter controls for application (otp_supervisor, phoenix, kernel, stdlib, custom)
3. WHEN viewing processes THEN the system SHALL provide node selection filter
4. WHEN filters are applied THEN the system SHALL re-execute ProcessList operation with updated parameters
5. WHEN viewing processes THEN the system SHALL provide real-time search input for process names, PIDs, or modules
6. WHEN search is performed THEN the system SHALL filter displayed processes without re-executing Arsenal operation
7. WHEN filters or search are active THEN the system SHALL display "Showing X of Y processes" indicator

### Requirement 3: Real-time Updates and Performance

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want process information to update automatically, so that I can monitor live system activity without manual refreshing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page mounts THEN the system SHALL subscribe to ClusterStateManager PubSub for cluster changes
2. WHEN cluster topology changes THEN the system SHALL refresh process list automatically
3. WHEN the page is active THEN the system SHALL refresh process data every 5 seconds
4. WHEN process data updates THEN the system SHALL maintain current filter and search state
5. WHEN handling large process lists THEN the system SHALL implement pagination with 100 processes per page
6. WHEN loading data THEN the system SHALL show loading indicators and disable controls

### Requirement 4: Terminal Aesthetic and Navigation

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want the cluster processes page to maintain visual consistency with other platform pages, so that I have a seamless experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page renders THEN the system SHALL use TerminalStatusBar with process-specific metrics
2. WHEN the page renders THEN the system SHALL use terminal color scheme (bg-gray-900, text-green-400)
3. WHEN the page renders THEN the system SHALL include TerminalNavigationLinks with "cluster-processes" as current page
4. WHEN the page renders THEN the system SHALL use consistent button styling and loading indicators
5. WHEN the page renders THEN the system SHALL follow LiveView patterns consistent with other platform pages
