# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for building essential developer tooling for distributed OTP systems development. The goal is to create a minimal but powerful arsenal of tools that enable developers to effectively work with LibCluster, Horde, and distributed BEAM systems while leveraging the existing Arsenal metaprogramming framework for rapid tool development.

The core insight is that we can dogfood our own platform - using Arsenal's auto-API generation to rapidly build the exact tooling we need for distributed development, creating a self-reinforcing development experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Single-Node Development Mode

**User Story:** As a developer working on distributed systems, I want to develop and test distributed features on a single node with simulated clustering, so that I can iterate quickly without the complexity of managing multiple nodes during development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer starts the system in development mode THEN the system SHALL automatically configure LibCluster and Horde for single-node operation with simulated multi-node behavior
2. WHEN distributed operations are executed in single-node mode THEN they SHALL behave identically to multi-node operations but execute locally
3. WHEN the developer switches to multi-node mode THEN all existing code SHALL work without modification
4. IF single-node mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL provide visual indicators in the UI showing the simulated distributed state

### Requirement 2: Cluster State Visualization

**User Story:** As a developer debugging distributed systems, I want real-time visualization of cluster topology, node health, and process distribution, so that I can understand the current state of my distributed system at a glance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the cluster state changes THEN the visualization SHALL update in real-time via LiveView
2. WHEN a node joins or leaves the cluster THEN the topology view SHALL reflect the change within 1 second
3. WHEN processes are distributed across nodes THEN the visualization SHALL show which processes are running on which nodes
4. IF a node becomes unhealthy THEN the visualization SHALL highlight the node with appropriate status indicators
5. WHEN the developer clicks on a node THEN detailed node information SHALL be displayed including resource usage and running processes

### Requirement 3: Distributed Process Management Arsenal

**User Story:** As a developer working with distributed processes, I want Arsenal operations that can manage processes across cluster nodes transparently, so that I can debug and control distributed processes as easily as local ones.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I execute a process operation via Arsenal THEN it SHALL work regardless of which node the target process is running on
2. WHEN I list processes THEN the results SHALL include processes from all cluster nodes with node identification
3. WHEN I kill a process on a remote node THEN the operation SHALL execute on the correct node and return success/failure status
4. IF a target node is unreachable THEN the operation SHALL return an appropriate error with node status information
5. WHEN I trace a process on a remote node THEN the trace data SHALL be collected and returned as if the process were local

### Requirement 4: Horde Registry and Supervisor Inspection

**User Story:** As a developer using Horde for distributed supervision, I want tools to inspect and manage Horde registries and supervisors across the cluster, so that I can understand how my distributed processes are organized and supervised.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I query Horde registry contents THEN I SHALL receive a unified view of all registered processes across all nodes
2. WHEN I inspect a Horde supervisor THEN I SHALL see all children regardless of which nodes they're running on
3. WHEN processes migrate between nodes THEN the inspection tools SHALL reflect the current location
4. IF Horde cluster membership changes THEN the inspection results SHALL automatically update to reflect the new topology
5. WHEN I start a process via Horde THEN I SHALL be able to specify placement preferences and see where it actually started

### Requirement 5: Distributed Sandbox Management

**User Story:** As a developer testing distributed code, I want to create and manage sandboxes that can span multiple nodes, so that I can test distributed scenarios in isolation without affecting the main system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create a distributed sandbox THEN it SHALL be able to spawn processes on multiple cluster nodes
2. WHEN I destroy a distributed sandbox THEN all processes on all nodes SHALL be cleaned up
3. WHEN a node becomes unavailable THEN sandbox processes on that node SHALL be handled gracefully
4. IF I specify node placement for sandbox processes THEN they SHALL be created on the requested nodes when possible
5. WHEN I execute code in a distributed sandbox THEN it SHALL have access to the full cluster topology

### Requirement 6: Cluster Health Monitoring

**User Story:** As a developer running distributed systems, I want continuous monitoring of cluster health with alerts for issues, so that I can proactively address problems before they impact development or testing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cluster health metrics are collected THEN they SHALL include node connectivity, resource usage, and process distribution
2. WHEN a health threshold is exceeded THEN the system SHALL generate an alert with actionable information
3. WHEN network partitions occur THEN they SHALL be detected and reported within 5 seconds
4. IF Horde processes fail to distribute properly THEN the monitoring SHALL detect and report the issue
5. WHEN cluster membership changes THEN health baselines SHALL be automatically adjusted

### Requirement 7: Development Workflow Integration

**User Story:** As a developer using the platform for distributed development, I want the tooling to integrate seamlessly with my development workflow, so that I can access distributed debugging capabilities without context switching.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I'm debugging in the web interface THEN I SHALL have access to all distributed operations without leaving the current page
2. WHEN I'm working with code THEN I SHALL be able to trigger distributed operations directly from the development environment
3. WHEN errors occur in distributed operations THEN they SHALL be displayed with full context and suggested remediation steps
4. IF I'm working on a specific feature THEN the tooling SHALL remember my context and preferences across sessions
5. WHEN I switch between single-node and multi-node modes THEN my current debugging session SHALL be preserved

### Requirement 8: Arsenal Operation Auto-Discovery

**User Story:** As a developer extending the distributed tooling, I want new Arsenal operations to be automatically discovered and exposed via the API, so that I can rapidly build new distributed debugging tools without manual configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create a new Arsenal operation module THEN it SHALL be automatically discovered and registered at startup
2. WHEN I add the operation to the known operations list THEN it SHALL be immediately available via the REST API
3. WHEN the operation implements the required callbacks THEN it SHALL automatically get proper error handling and response formatting
4. IF the operation has parameter validation THEN it SHALL be automatically enforced by the Arsenal framework
5. WHEN I deploy new operations THEN they SHALL be available without restarting the system

### Requirement 9: Performance Impact Minimization

**User Story:** As a developer using distributed debugging tools, I want the tooling to have minimal impact on system performance, so that I can debug production-like scenarios without significantly altering system behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN distributed operations are executed THEN they SHALL add less than 10ms latency to normal system operations
2. WHEN cluster monitoring is active THEN it SHALL consume less than 5% of system CPU and memory
3. WHEN tracing distributed processes THEN the trace overhead SHALL not exceed 15% performance impact
4. IF monitoring detects high resource usage THEN it SHALL automatically reduce monitoring frequency
5. WHEN the system is under load THEN non-essential monitoring SHALL be automatically throttled

### Requirement 10: Error Recovery and Resilience

**User Story:** As a developer working with distributed systems, I want the debugging tools themselves to be resilient to cluster failures, so that I can debug issues even when the cluster is in a degraded state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a cluster node fails THEN the debugging tools SHALL continue to work with the remaining nodes
2. WHEN network partitions occur THEN each partition SHALL maintain independent debugging capabilities
3. WHEN Horde processes restart THEN the debugging tools SHALL automatically reconnect and resume monitoring
4. IF the debugging tools themselves crash THEN they SHALL restart automatically without losing critical state
5. WHEN cluster membership changes THEN all debugging sessions SHALL gracefully adapt to the new topology
