# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current distributed testing workflow requires manual cluster management, making it cumbersome for developers to run distributed tests. We need to integrate the robust cluster testing system we built into the standard Mix test workflow, making distributed testing as easy as running `mix test --distributed` or having tests automatically detect when they need a cluster and start one.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Automatic Cluster Detection and Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want distributed tests to automatically start and manage test clusters, so that I don't need to manually run cluster commands before testing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `mix test` with distributed tests THEN the system SHALL automatically detect tests that need a cluster
2. WHEN distributed tests are detected THEN the system SHALL automatically start a test cluster before running tests
3. WHEN all distributed tests complete THEN the system SHALL automatically clean up the test cluster
4. IF a test cluster is already running THEN the system SHALL reuse the existing cluster
5. WHEN cluster startup fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and skip distributed tests gracefully

### Requirement 2: Ergonomic Test Workflow Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use simple Mix commands for distributed testing, so that the workflow feels natural and integrated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `mix test --distributed` THEN it SHALL run all tests including distributed ones with automatic cluster management
2. WHEN I run `mix test --only distributed` THEN it SHALL run only distributed tests with cluster management
3. WHEN I run `mix test` without flags THEN it SHALL run non-distributed tests normally and skip distributed tests
4. IF I want to force cluster usage THEN `mix test --force-cluster` SHALL start a cluster for all tests
5. WHEN using test filters THEN the system SHALL intelligently determine if a cluster is needed

### Requirement 3: Test Environment Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure distributed test behavior through standard Mix configuration, so that I can customize the testing environment for my project needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring test cluster size THEN I SHALL be able to set node count in test configuration
2. WHEN configuring cluster timeouts THEN I SHALL be able to set startup and cleanup timeouts
3. WHEN configuring cluster ports THEN I SHALL be able to override default port ranges
4. IF I want to disable automatic cluster management THEN I SHALL be able to configure manual mode
5. WHEN running in CI/CD THEN the system SHALL adapt configuration for automated environments

### Requirement 4: Test Tagging and Organization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to organize distributed tests with clear tagging, so that I can run different types of distributed tests selectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing distributed tests THEN I SHALL tag them with `@tag :distributed`
2. WHEN writing cluster-specific tests THEN I SHALL tag them with `@tag :cluster`
3. WHEN writing multi-node tests THEN I SHALL tag them with `@tag :multi_node`
4. IF tests require specific cluster sizes THEN I SHALL tag them with `@tag cluster_size: 3`
5. WHEN running tagged tests THEN the system SHALL start appropriate cluster configurations

### Requirement 5: Test Helper Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want enhanced test helpers that work seamlessly with the automatic cluster management, so that writing distributed tests is straightforward.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using ClusterTestHelper THEN it SHALL integrate with automatic cluster management
2. WHEN tests need specific cluster configurations THEN helpers SHALL request appropriate setups
3. WHEN multiple tests run concurrently THEN helpers SHALL coordinate cluster usage safely
4. IF cluster operations fail THEN helpers SHALL provide detailed error information
5. WHEN tests complete THEN helpers SHALL ensure proper cleanup without interfering with other tests

### Requirement 6: Performance and Reliability

**User Story:** As a developer, I want distributed test execution to be fast and reliable, so that it integrates well into my development workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting test clusters THEN startup SHALL complete within 30 seconds
2. WHEN reusing existing clusters THEN test execution SHALL start immediately
3. WHEN running multiple test suites THEN cluster reuse SHALL optimize performance
4. IF cluster operations fail THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff
5. WHEN tests are interrupted THEN cleanup SHALL happen automatically

### Requirement 7: Development Experience

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear feedback and debugging information during distributed testing, so that I can troubleshoot issues quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cluster operations occur THEN I SHALL see clear progress indicators
2. WHEN cluster startup fails THEN I SHALL get actionable error messages with solutions
3. WHEN tests are skipped due to cluster issues THEN I SHALL be notified with reasons
4. IF I want verbose output THEN `--verbose` flag SHALL show detailed cluster operations
5. WHEN debugging cluster issues THEN I SHALL have access to cluster logs and diagnostics

### Requirement 8: CI/CD Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want distributed tests to work reliably in CI/CD environments, so that automated testing includes distributed scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running in CI/CD THEN the system SHALL detect the environment and adapt configuration
2. WHEN CI resources are limited THEN the system SHALL use smaller cluster configurations
3. WHEN CI networking is restricted THEN the system SHALL use appropriate hostname resolution
4. IF CI timeouts are strict THEN the system SHALL respect CI-specific timeout configurations
5. WHEN CI artifacts are needed THEN the system SHALL generate appropriate test reports

### Requirement 9: Backward Compatibility

**User Story:** As a developer, I want existing tests to continue working unchanged, so that adopting automatic cluster management doesn't break my current test suite.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN existing non-distributed tests run THEN they SHALL work exactly as before
2. WHEN existing manual cluster management is used THEN it SHALL continue to work
3. WHEN existing ClusterTestHelper usage exists THEN it SHALL remain functional
4. IF projects have custom cluster setup THEN they SHALL be able to disable automatic management
5. WHEN migrating to automatic management THEN the transition SHALL be gradual and optional

### Requirement 10: Resource Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want distributed testing to manage system resources efficiently, so that it doesn't interfere with other development activities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN test clusters start THEN they SHALL use minimal necessary resources
2. WHEN tests complete THEN all cluster resources SHALL be cleaned up automatically
3. WHEN multiple test runs occur THEN resource conflicts SHALL be prevented
4. IF system resources are low THEN the system SHALL adapt cluster size appropriately
5. WHEN development servers are running THEN test clusters SHALL use different ports automatically
