# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current mix cluster.test functionality is failing due to networking and hostname resolution issues in the distributed test environment. The system needs robust cluster management with proper hostname handling, port management, and comprehensive error diagnostics to enable reliable distributed testing.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Robust Network Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the cluster test system to automatically detect and configure proper network settings, so that I don't have to manually troubleshoot networking issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts cluster testing THEN it SHALL automatically detect the current hostname and network configuration
2. WHEN hostname resolution fails THEN the system SHALL fallback to IP-based addressing with proper diagnostics
3. WHEN EPMD is not running THEN the system SHALL attempt to start it automatically or provide clear instructions
4. IF network interfaces are misconfigured THEN the system SHALL provide specific remediation steps
5. WHEN using WSL or containerized environments THEN the system SHALL adapt networking configuration appropriately

### Requirement 2: Intelligent Port Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the cluster system to handle port conflicts gracefully, so that tests don't fail due to port availability issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN test ports are unavailable THEN the system SHALL automatically find alternative ports
2. WHEN port conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear diagnostics about which processes are using the ports
3. WHEN cleaning up after tests THEN the system SHALL ensure all test processes are properly terminated
4. IF port scanning is needed THEN the system SHALL efficiently check port availability across the required range
5. WHEN multiple test runs occur THEN the system SHALL prevent port conflicts between concurrent test sessions

### Requirement 3: Enhanced Hostname Resolution

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the cluster system to work reliably across different environments (localhost, 127.0.0.1, actual hostnames), so that tests work consistently regardless of my development setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN determining node names THEN the system SHALL use the most appropriate hostname format for the current environment
2. WHEN localhost resolution fails THEN the system SHALL fallback to 127.0.0.1 automatically
3. WHEN using actual hostnames THEN the system SHALL validate hostname resolution before proceeding
4. IF hostname resolution is inconsistent THEN the system SHALL provide diagnostic information and suggested fixes
5. WHEN running in different environments (WSL, Docker, native) THEN the system SHALL adapt hostname strategy accordingly

### Requirement 4: Comprehensive Error Diagnostics

**User Story:** As a developer, I want detailed error messages and troubleshooting guidance when cluster tests fail, so that I can quickly identify and fix issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cluster startup fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages with remediation steps
2. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL run diagnostic checks and report findings
3. WHEN node connection fails THEN the system SHALL test connectivity and report specific failure points
4. IF EPMD issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide EPMD-specific diagnostics and solutions
5. WHEN environment validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide a comprehensive environment report

### Requirement 5: Reliable Test Node Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want test nodes to start and stop reliably, so that my distributed tests are deterministic and don't leave orphaned processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting test nodes THEN the system SHALL ensure proper initialization and health verification
2. WHEN test nodes fail to start THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff and clear failure reporting
3. WHEN stopping test nodes THEN the system SHALL ensure graceful shutdown with timeout handling
4. IF test nodes become unresponsive THEN the system SHALL force cleanup and prevent resource leaks
5. WHEN test cleanup occurs THEN the system SHALL verify all test artifacts are removed

### Requirement 6: Environment Adaptation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the cluster system to work seamlessly across different development environments, so that I don't need environment-specific configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running on WSL THEN the system SHALL handle WSL-specific networking constraints
2. WHEN running in Docker THEN the system SHALL adapt to container networking
3. WHEN running on different operating systems THEN the system SHALL use appropriate network configuration
4. IF running in CI/CD environments THEN the system SHALL detect and adapt to automated testing constraints
5. WHEN environment detection fails THEN the system SHALL provide manual configuration options

### Requirement 7: Performance and Reliability

**User Story:** As a developer, I want cluster tests to start quickly and run reliably, so that they integrate well into my development workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting a cluster THEN the system SHALL complete startup within 30 seconds under normal conditions
2. WHEN network latency is high THEN the system SHALL adjust timeouts appropriately
3. WHEN system resources are constrained THEN the system SHALL adapt resource allocation
4. IF cluster formation takes too long THEN the system SHALL provide progress updates and timeout warnings
5. WHEN running multiple test cycles THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent performance

### Requirement 8: Integration with Existing Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the enhanced cluster system to work seamlessly with existing test infrastructure, so that current tests continue to work without modification.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN existing tests run THEN they SHALL continue to work with the enhanced cluster system
2. WHEN using ClusterTestHelper THEN it SHALL provide backward compatibility with existing APIs
3. WHEN simulation mode is used THEN it SHALL work alongside real cluster testing
4. IF existing configuration exists THEN the system SHALL respect and enhance it rather than replace it
5. WHEN integrating with CI/CD THEN the system SHALL maintain existing integration points
