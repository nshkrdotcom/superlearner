## Persona 1: Alex the Application Developer

### Profile
- **Role:** Backend Developer
- **Experience:** 2-3 years Elixir, learning OTP
- **Team Size:** 5-10 developers
- **Context:** Building production web applications

### Goals
- Write reliable, maintainable tests
- Learn OTP patterns properly
- Ship features without breaking production
- Debug issues quickly

### Pain Points
- Tests fail randomly in CI
- Can't run tests in parallel safely
- Struggling with OTP supervision concepts
- Production debugging is difficult

### Primary Libraries Used
1. **Supertester** (daily) - Testing framework
2. **SuperLearner** (weekly) - Learning resource
3. **Arsenal** (occasional) - Production debugging

### Typical Workflows

#### Workflow 1: Writing a New Feature Test
```
1. Create test file
2. Import Supertester helpers
3. Setup isolated GenServer
   {:ok, pid} = setup_isolated_genserver(MyWorker)
4. Test feature behavior
   assert_genserver_state(pid, fn state -> state.count == 5 end)
5. Run test suite (all async)
   mix test --async
6. Tests pass consistently ✓
```

**Time Saved:** 30 minutes per feature (no debugging flaky tests)

#### Workflow 2: Learning New OTP Pattern
```
1. Open SuperLearner web UI
   http://localhost:4000/supervisors
2. Explore visual supervision tree
3. Click to kill process, observe restart
4. Review pattern in documentation
5. Implement in own code
6. Test with Supertester
```

**Time Saved:** 2-3 hours (visual understanding vs reading docs)

#### Workflow 3: Debugging Production Issue
```
1. Access Arsenal API
   curl http://prod:4000/api/v1/supervisors
2. Identify problematic process
   curl http://prod:4000/api/v1/processes/<pid>/info
3. Enable message tracing
   curl -X POST http://prod:4000/api/v1/processes/<pid>/trace
4. Analyze trace data
5. Fix issue
6. Verify with test
```

**Time Saved:** 1-2 hours (vs manual debugging)

### Success Metrics
- **Before:** 10-15% test failures in CI
- **After:** <1% test failures
- **Before:** 4-5 hours per feature (including test debugging)
- **After:** 2-3 hours per feature
