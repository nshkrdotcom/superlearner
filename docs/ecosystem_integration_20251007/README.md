## Overview

This documentation series provides a comprehensive design for integrating the six libraries in the SuperLearner ecosystem into a cohesive, production-ready platform for OTP education and development.

## The Ecosystem

**SuperLearner** is built from six specialized libraries:

1. **SuperLearner** - Phoenix LiveView educational platform (core)
2. **Arsenal** - Metaprogramming framework for REST APIs from OTP operations
3. **Arsenal Plug** - Phoenix/Plug adapter for Arsenal operations
4. **Supertester** - Battle-hardened OTP testing toolkit
5. **OTP Sandbox** - Isolated process experimentation environments
6. **Playwriter** - Cross-platform browser automation with WSL integration
