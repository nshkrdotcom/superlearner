## Current Integration Status

### ✅ Fully Integrated
- **Arsenal → SuperLearner**: Arsenal operations embedded in `lib/otp_supervisor/core/arsenal/`
- **Arsenal Plug → SuperLearner**: Used for API routing (needs verification in router)
- **Supertester → SuperLearner**: Used throughout test suite

### ⚠️ Partially Integrated
- **OTP Sandbox → SuperLearner**: Path dependency exists, but functionality is in `SandboxManager`
- **Playwriter → SuperLearner**: Listed as dev/test dependency but usage unclear

### ❌ Missing Integration
- **Supertester → OTP Sandbox**: Could provide better test utilities
- **Arsenal Operations → All Libraries**: Libraries not exposing operations
- **Unified Documentation**: Cross-library documentation linking

## Design Principles

### 1. Separation of Concerns
- Each library has a single, well-defined responsibility
- Clear boundaries between testing, operations, isolation, and automation

### 2. Composability
- Libraries designed to work together but remain independent
- Can be used in isolation or as integrated ecosystem

### 3. Production-Ready Patterns
- Real-world OTP patterns demonstrated throughout
- Performance, monitoring, and error handling built-in
- Educational focus without sacrificing quality

### 4. Test-Driven Architecture
- Comprehensive test coverage across all libraries
- Testing infrastructure (Supertester) as first-class citizen
- Isolated testing environments (OTP Sandbox) for safety

### 5. Developer Experience
- Clear, consistent APIs across libraries
- Comprehensive documentation and examples
- Interactive learning through SuperLearner platform
