## Use Cases by Role

### For Development Teams

#### Use Case 1: Build Reliable Test Suites
**Problem:** Tests are flaky, fail randomly, can't run in parallel
**Solution:** Supertester provides deterministic OTP testing
**Benefits:**
- Eliminate `Process.sleep` completely
- Run all tests with `async: true`
- Reliable CI/CD pipeline
- Faster test execution

**Example:**
```elixir
# Before: Flaky test with sleep
test "process restarts" do
  pid = start_process()
  kill_process(pid)
  Process.sleep(100)  # Hope it restarted?
  assert Process.alive?(new_pid)
end

# After: Deterministic with Supertester
test "process restarts" do
  {:ok, pid} = setup_isolated_genserver(Worker)
  test_server_crash_recovery(pid, :kill)
  assert_process_alive(pid)  # Guaranteed synchronization
end
```

#### Use Case 2: Monitor Production Systems
**Problem:** Need visibility into OTP process behavior
**Solution:** Arsenal operations + SuperLearner dashboard
**Benefits:**
- Real-time process inspection
- Supervisor health monitoring

curl http://localhost:4000/api/v1/supervisors

# Get process information
curl http://localhost:4000/api/v1/processes/<pid>/info

# Monitor cluster health
curl http://localhost:4000/api/v1/cluster/health
```

#### Use Case 3: Safe Code Experimentation
**Problem:** Testing new code affects production systems
**Solution:** Sandbox provides isolated environments
**Benefits:**

# Test new code safely
Sandbox.compile_file("new_feature.ex")
Sandbox.hot_reload(sandbox, beam_data)

# Roll back if needed
Sandbox.rollback_module(sandbox, MyModule, previous_version)
```

    max_time_ms: 50,
    max_memory_bytes: 1_000_000
  )
end

test "no memory leak in processing loop" do
  assert_no_memory_leak(10_000, fn ->
    Worker.process_message(message)
  end)
end
```
