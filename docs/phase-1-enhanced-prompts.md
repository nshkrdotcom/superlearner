# Phase 1 Enhanced: Professional Debugging Features

## Overview

These prompts (11-15) enhance Phase 1 to deliver real debugging and analysis value, transforming it from a basic educational tool into a professional OTP introspection platform.

   - get_process_state/1 - Extract GenServer/Agent state using :sys.get_state/1
   - get_process_links/1 - Get all linked processes
   - get_process_monitors/1 - Get monitoring relationships
   - get_message_queue/1 - Inspect actual messages in queue
   - get_process_dictionary/1 - Access process dictionary
   - get_stack_trace/1 - Current stack trace

2. Add process relationship analysis:
   - build_process_graph/0 - Build complete relationship graph of all processes
   - find_orphan_processes/0 - Processes without supervisors
   - trace_failure_impact/1 - What dies if this process dies?
   - find_process_bottlenecks/0 - Processes with growing message queues

3. Add performance metrics:
   - get_process_metrics/1 - CPU usage, reductions, memory over time
   - profile_process/2 - Profile for N seconds
   - get_system_metrics/0 - Overall system health

Include proper error handling and make functions work with both registered names and PIDs.
```

## Prompt 12: Message Flow Analysis

**Prompt:**
```
Create lib/otp_supervisor/core/message_tracer.ex for debugging message flow:

1. Message tracing capabilities:
   - trace_messages/2 - Start tracing messages for a process
   - stop_tracing/1 - Stop message tracing
   - get_message_history/1 - Get traced messages
   - trace_message_path/1 - Follow a specific message through the system

2. Message analysis:
   - analyze_message_patterns/1 - Identify common message patterns
   - detect_message_loops/0 - Find circular message paths
   - measure_message_latency/2 - Time between send and receive

3. Interactive message tools:
   - intercept_messages/2 - Add logging/transformation to messages
   - replay_messages/2 - Replay recorded messages
   - inject_message/2 - Send custom messages for testing

This module enables real debugging of message-passing issues in production systems.
```

## Prompt 13: Advanced Supervisor Control

**Prompt:**
```
Enhance supervisor control in lib/otp_supervisor/core/control.ex:

1. Supervisor analytics:
   - get_restart_history/1 - Track all restarts with timestamps and reasons
   - calculate_restart_intensity/1 - Current restart intensity
   - predict_restart_storm/1 - Warn if approaching intensity limits
   - get_child_dependencies/1 - Which children depend on each other

2. Runtime supervisor manipulation:
   - pause_supervisor/1 - Temporarily prevent restarts (for maintenance)
   - resume_supervisor/1 - Re-enable supervision
   - change_restart_strategy/2 - Modify strategy at runtime
   - update_child_spec/3 - Modify child specifications
   - add_child_dynamically/2 - Add new children to static supervisors

3. Failure simulation:
   - simulate_crash/3 - Crash child with specific reason
   - simulate_memory_pressure/2 - Make process use more memory
   - simulate_cpu_load/2 - Make process CPU intensive
   - simulate_message_flood/2 - Flood process with messages

These tools help test supervision strategies in development and debug issues in production.

## Prompt 14: System Analysis Dashboard

**Prompt:**
```
Create lib/otp_supervisor_web/live/system_dashboard_live.ex with:

1. System-wide metrics view:
   - Total process count with trend graph
   - Memory usage by process type
   - Message queue depths across system
   - CPU usage distribution
   - Supervision tree health score

2. Anomaly detection:
   - Processes with abnormal memory growth
   - Processes with growing message queues
   - Unsupervised long-running processes
   - Potential memory leaks
   - Supervision anti-patterns

3. Interactive debugging tools:
   - Process search with filters (name, module, state content)
   - Bulk operations (kill matching processes)
   - State inspection with pretty printing
   - Message injection interface
   - Process relationship explorer

4. Export capabilities:
   - Download system report as JSON
   - Export supervision tree as DOT graph
   - Save process state snapshots
   - Generate performance reports

Add route "/system" to router.ex for this dashboard.
```

## Prompt 15: REST API for Debugging Tools

**Prompt:**
```
Create lib/otp_supervisor_web/controllers/api/ with REST endpoints:

1. Process API (api/v1/process_controller.ex):
   GET    /api/v1/processes - List all with filters
   GET    /api/v1/processes/:pid - Full process details
   GET    /api/v1/processes/:pid/state - GenServer state
   GET    /api/v1/processes/:pid/messages - Message queue
   GET    /api/v1/processes/:pid/links - Process links
   POST   /api/v1/processes/:pid/trace - Start tracing
   DELETE /api/v1/processes/:pid/trace - Stop tracing
   POST   /api/v1/processes/:pid/message - Send message

2. System API (api/v1/system_controller.ex):
   GET    /api/v1/system/health - System health metrics
   GET    /api/v1/system/graph - Process relationship graph

## Success Criteria (Enhanced Phase 1)

After completing prompts 1-15:
- [ ] Professional debugging interface at /supervisors
- [ ] System analysis dashboard at /system  
- [ ] Complete REST API for external tools
- [ ] Deep process introspection capabilities
- [ ] Message flow debugging tools
- [ ] Performance profiling features
- [ ] Anomaly detection and alerts
- [ ] Production-ready error handling
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage
- [ ] API documentation

## Why This Matters

With these enhancements, Phase 1 delivers:
1. **Immediate value** - Developers can use it for real debugging today
2. **Production ready** - Safe to use on live systems
3. **Tool integration** - REST API enables custom tooling
4. **Foundation for growth** - Educational features build on solid base

The educational aspect becomes one use case of a professional platform, not the only purpose.
