# OTP Supervisor Educational Tool - Features Overview

## Core Features

### 1. Programmatic Supervisor Control

The Phoenix application provides a comprehensive API for controlling Elixir supervisors:

- **Process Management**
  - Start/stop supervisors with different strategies
  - Add/remove children dynamically
  - Restart individual processes
  - Change restart strategies on the fly

- **Fault Injection**
  - Kill processes with various exit reasons
  - Simulate different failure scenarios
  - Test supervisor recovery behavior
  - Measure restart times and frequencies

- **State Inspection**
  - View process state without interrupting execution
  - Monitor message queues
  - Track memory usage
  - Inspect supervision trees in real-time

### 2. Web-Based Visualization

- **Interactive Process Tree**
  - D3.js-based visualization of supervision hierarchies
  - Click to inspect/manipulate individual processes
  - Real-time updates as processes start/stop/restart
  - Color coding for different process types and states

- **Phoenix LiveDashboard Integration**
  - Built-in system metrics and monitoring
  - Custom pages for supervisor-specific metrics
  - Historical data tracking
  - Performance analysis tools

- **Observer Integration**
  - Embedded Observer UI within the Phoenix app
  - Programmatic access to Observer data
  - Custom overlays and annotations
  - Educational tooltips explaining Observer features

### 3. Code Hot-Reloading System

- **Live Code Editing**
  - Built-in code editor with syntax highlighting
  - Compile and reload modules without stopping the system
  - See immediate effects of code changes
  - Rollback capability for failed changes

- **API Endpoint for Code Updates**
  - POST endpoint to update module code
  - Automatic compilation and hot-swapping
  - Error handling and reporting
  - Version tracking

### 4. Educational Abstractions

The system provides high-level functions specifically designed for learning:

```elixir
# Demonstrate different supervisor strategies
Educational.demonstrate_one_for_one()
Educational.demonstrate_all_for_one()
Educational.demonstrate_rest_for_one()

# Show failure scenarios
Educational.demonstrate_cascade_failure()
Educational.demonstrate_restart_intensity_exceeded()
Educational.demonstrate_permanent_vs_temporary_children()

# Advanced patterns
Educational.demonstrate_dynamic_supervisor()
Educational.demonstrate_partition_supervisor()
```

### 5. Interactive Learning Modules

- **Guided Tutorials**
  - Step-by-step walkthroughs of supervisor concepts
  - Interactive exercises with immediate feedback
  - Progress tracking and badges

- **Scenario Builder**
  - Create custom supervision trees
  - Define failure scenarios
  - Test different strategies
  - Share scenarios with others

- **Challenge Mode**
  - Solve supervisor design problems
  - Optimize for specific failure patterns
  - Compete on leaderboards

### 6. Real-time Monitoring

- **WebSocket Channels**
  - Live updates of process states
  - Streaming logs and events
  - Collaborative features (multiple users can observe same system)

- **Metrics Collection**
  - Restart frequencies
  - Process lifetimes
  - Memory usage patterns
  - Message queue depths

### 7. API Endpoints

**REST API:**
- `GET /api/supervisors` - List all supervisors
- `POST /api/supervisors` - Create new supervisor
- `GET /api/supervisors/:id/tree` - Get supervision tree
- `POST /api/supervisors/:id/children` - Add child
- `DELETE /api/supervisors/:id/children/:child_id` - Remove child
- `POST /api/processes/:pid/kill` - Kill process
- `POST /api/code/reload` - Reload code
- `GET /api/educational/scenarios` - List educational scenarios
- `POST /api/educational/run/:scenario` - Run educational scenario

**WebSocket Channels:**
- `supervisor:lobby` - Real-time supervisor updates
- `process:inspect` - Process state streaming
- `code:compile` - Live compilation results
- `educational:session` - Interactive tutorial sessions

## Unique Advantages

### 1. No Browser REPL Required
While the system can integrate with IEx, the comprehensive API eliminates the need for a browser-based REPL. All supervisor operations are available through the web UI and API.

### 2. Sandboxed Execution
The target Elixir application runs in isolation, allowing users to experiment freely without affecting the Phoenix control application.

### 3. Educational Focus
Unlike generic monitoring tools, this system is designed specifically for learning OTP concepts with built-in tutorials and explanations.

### 4. Production-Ready Patterns
The code and patterns used in the tool are production-quality, meaning users learn best practices they can apply in real applications.

### 5. Extensibility
The modular design allows for easy addition of new educational scenarios, visualization types, and supervisor patterns.

## Use Cases

### For Learning
- Understanding supervisor strategies through visualization
- Experimenting with failure scenarios safely
- Following guided tutorials on OTP concepts
- Building intuition about fault-tolerant design

### For Development
- Testing supervisor configurations
- Debugging complex supervision trees
- Performance tuning restart strategies
- Prototyping fault-tolerant architectures

### For Teaching
- Live demonstrations in classrooms
- Interactive assignments
- Student progress tracking
- Collaborative learning sessions

## Technical Innovation

### 1. Unified Control Interface
Single Phoenix app controls and monitors separate Elixir processes, providing a clean separation of concerns.

### 2. Real-time Visualization
LiveView enables real-time updates without complex JavaScript, making the tool more maintainable.

### 3. Programmatic Observer Access
Exposes Observer functionality through APIs, enabling automated testing and analysis.

### 4. Educational Abstractions
High-level functions that encapsulate complex OTP patterns, making them accessible to beginners.

This tool represents a significant advancement in Elixir/OTP education, providing hands-on experience with supervisor design patterns in a safe, interactive environment.
