## Key Insights from Observer CLI

### 1. Performance Metrics That Matter

Observer CLI focuses on metrics that directly impact production systems:
- **Scheduler Utilization**: Not just CPU usage, but actual scheduler efficiency
- **Reductions**: BEAM's unit of work, crucial for understanding process load
- **Binary Memory**: Often overlooked but critical for memory leaks
- **Port/Socket Statistics**: Network I/O patterns and bottlenecks
- **Allocator Efficiency**: Cache hit rates and fragmentation

### 2. Information Density

Observer CLI excels at presenting maximum information in minimal space:
- Compact table layouts
- Color-coded alerts (red when thresholds exceeded)
- Keyboard shortcuts for quick navigation
- Incremental values showing growth/change
- Smart truncation of large data structures

### 3. Production Safety

Design choices that make it safe for production:
- Read-only by default
- Minimal resource consumption
- No side effects on observed system
- Graceful handling of large data sets
- Timeout protection for expensive operations

## Recommendations for OTP Supervisor

### High-Impact Features to Adopt

1. **Enhanced Process Monitoring**
   - Sort processes by reductions, memory, message queue
   - Show reduction rate (work done over time)
   - Binary memory per process
   - Process status (running, waiting, suspended)

2. **Scheduler Utilization Widget**
   - Real scheduler usage vs OS-reported CPU
   - Per-scheduler breakdown
   - Scheduler sleep time analysis

3. **Memory Allocator Dashboard**
   - Allocator efficiency metrics
   - Cache hit rates
   - Fragmentation indicators
   - Memory carrier utilization

4. **Port and Socket Analytics**
   - Active connections table
   - Bandwidth usage per port
   - Socket option inspection
   - Driver queue sizes

5. **ETS Table Monitor**
   - Table sizes and memory usage
   - Access patterns
   - Table configuration details

### Integration Approach

1. **Create New LiveView Pages**
   - `/allocators` - Memory allocator dashboard
   - `/ports` - Port and socket monitoring
   - `/ets` - ETS table analytics
   - `/schedulers` - Scheduler utilization

2. **Enhance Existing Components**
   - Add reduction-based sorting to ProcessListWidget
   - Include binary memory in process details
   - Show scheduler assignment for processes

3. **Add Production-Grade Features**
   - Threshold-based alerting
   - Historical data retention (last N minutes)
   - Export capabilities for metrics

4. **Terminal Mode**
   - Consider adding a text-based view mode
   - Useful for SSH access to production environments
   - Provides fallback when web interface unavailable
